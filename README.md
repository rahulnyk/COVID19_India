# State wise timeseries data of covid19 cases in India

**NOTE: In an effort to consolidate the data, we have moved it to the new repo**

https://github.com/rahulnyk/covid19_india_data


The data is compiled manually using the daily updates about the outbreak on Ministry of Health and Family Welfare site: https://www.mohfw.gov.in/
Will try to keep it as updated as possible. Please feel free point out any mistakes.
